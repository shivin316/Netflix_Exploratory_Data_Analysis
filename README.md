Netflix is an American subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service owned and operated by Netflix, Inc. The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by the media company of the same name from various genres, and it is available internationally in multiple languages.

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Netflix data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. EDA is an essential step in data analysis, helping us gain insights, discover patterns, and understand the underlying structure of the dataset.

# Project Overview
In this project, we explore and analyze Netflix data to answer various questions and visualize trends, such as:

- Trends in the number of shows and movies added over time.

- The distribution of content across different countries.

- Popular genres and their distribution.

- Content ratings and their distribution.

- Analysis of actors and directors with the most content.

This project aims to provide insights into Netflix's content library and helps data enthusiasts and analysts understand the dynamics of the platform's offerings.
